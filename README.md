## Configuration

Right now there are two types of configuration types:

* **Temperature**
  Choose the color temperature that is right for you and keep your eyes comfortable by limiting blue light and using warmer colors.
  Using at night can make it easier to fall asleep.

* **Color**
  Choose whichever color that is right for you.

You can also change the brightness of your screen if it is **DDC/CI** compatible.

## Hot keys
